## About this repository and its Actions

* [@helm/kind-action](https://github.com/helm/kind-action)
* [@helm/chart-testing-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing-action)
* [@helm/chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action)

## Project Status

`master` supports Helm 3 only, i. e. both `v1` and `v2` [API version](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) charts are installable.

## Chart Sources

* `charts/confluence-server`: Atlassian Confluence Server chart @ [helm.mox.sh](https://mox.sh/helm/charts/confluence-server/)
* `charts/jira-software`: Jira Software chart @ [helm.mox.sh](https://mox.sh/helm/charts/jira-software/)

## Adding charts to the mox helm repository

* Fork this repository
* Create a branch off master named after the chart
* Commit and push origin the new branch
* Create a Pull Request

## Results

* The [Lint and Test Charts](/.github/workflows/lint-test.yaml) workflow uses [@helm/kind-action](https://www.github.com/helm/kind-action) GitHub Action to spin up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) Kubernetes cluster, and [@helm/chart-testing-action](https://www.github.com/helm/chart-testing-action) to lint and test the charts on every Pull Request and push
  
* The [Release Charts](/.github/workflows/release.yaml) workflow uses [@helm/chart-releaser-action](https://www.github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) to turn this GitHub project into a self-hosted Helm chart repo. It does this – during every push to `master` – by checking each chart in this project, and whenever there's a new chart version, creates a corresponding [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) named for the chart version, adds Helm chart artifacts to the release, and creates or updates an `index.yaml` file with metadata about those releases, which is then hosted on GitHub Pages
